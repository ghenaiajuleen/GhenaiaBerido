        <h2>Background..</h2>
        <p>
          I finsihed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science last March 2019 in
          the Philippines. After graduation, I worked as a Customer Service
          Representative for three years just to be able to provide a support to
          my family in terms of financial need.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I used to study, watch movies, play volleyball, play
          mobile games and make up my mind about what I wanted to do with my
          life. I moved to Canada to study and work at the same time to achieve
          my aspirations and goals in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point in time, I am an International Student who is taking up
          a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma - CyberSecurity in Douglas College here
          in British Columbia, Canada.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals..</h2>
        <p>To develop my skills in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Network Security Control</li>
          <li>Intrusion detection</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I persevered and worked hard towards one goal - to excel in
          technology. Programming is my passion; it offers the opportunity to
          improve current systems and to develop controls over the electronic
          data inputs by the users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to become part of the highly skilled professionals who
          safeguard the data of the users and organizations in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be happy and able to help my family in terms of financial or any
          type of aspect in life.
