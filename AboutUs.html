              <h3>Ghenaia Juleen Berido</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              I am Ghenaia Juleen M. Berido, 19-year old born on July 17,2005. I
              was raised at Poblacion, Pilar, Abra. I have two siblings, one
              brother and one sister and I am the youngest. My zodiac sign is
              Cancer which is known for being loyal, emotional, caring, likes to
              plan things out, always there for friends, sensitive.
            </p>

            <p>
              When people first meet me, their first impression of me always is
              that I'm grumpy because of my resting face but when they get to
              know me, it's the other way around. Once I get comfortable with a
              person, I'm the most caring, annoying person you have ever met. I
              act like a complete weirdo and talk about the most random stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am passionate about studying because it helps me grow and learn
              new things. Studying brings me a sense of accomplishment, opens up
              new opportunities, and equips me with skills for various
              situations. It also shows hard work pays off and demonstrates
              one's capability to achieve goals. The constant learning keeps one
              motivated, promoting self-improvement and preparedness for life.
              Especially with the path I’ve chosen, which is to save lives,
              learning must continue.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I had to choose one trait I would like to improve about myself,
              it would be my ability to manage stress more effectively. Stress
              has always been something I’ve struggled with, and it’s a constant
              challenge to find ways to handle it in a healthy and constructive
              manner. Often, I find myself overwhelmed by deadlines,
              responsibilities, or the pressures of everyday life, and I tend to
              react by either overthinking or becoming anxious. Improving my
              stress management skills would not only benefit my emotional
              well-being, but it would also improve my productivity and my
              relationships with others.
